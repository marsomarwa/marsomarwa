title: About me
---

I was born in Tetouan, a northern Mediterranean city in Morocco 🪬 . When I was 3 years old, I moved to Tarragona 🏖️, another northern Mediterranean city in Spain, where I lived until it was time to start university.

I pursued a double bachelor's degree in Physics and Mathematics at the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB), focusing on Theoretical Physics (though I will always cherish my mathematician side 🤓). During the pandemic, I took a break from my academic path to explore data analysis while working at a green energy electric startup. Afterward, I decided to pursue a master's degree, which led me to Munich, where I studied Quantum Science and Technology at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and Ludwig Maximilian University (LMU). In my final year, I completed my Master’s Thesis at BMW Group, contributing to the expansion of a benchmarking quantum framework for quantum machine learning and conducting related studies.

Now, I have taken a "quantum jump" to Singapore, where I work in Dimitris Angelakis' group on Quantum Algorithms, Optimization, QML, and related topics.

Beyond my quantum endeavors, I love to read  📚 ([here](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/203651.Curated_list_od_books_that_shaped_me) you can check some books that shaped me), travel in a conscious and sustainable way, and crochet 🧶  items for my fashion wardrobe and stimulate creative brain side. I also balance my workout routine with different discoveries like Muay Thai 🇹🇭 , Barre  🩰 , Calisthenics  🤸‍♀️ .
