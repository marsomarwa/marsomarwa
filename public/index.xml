      <description>I was born in Tetouan, a northern Mediterranean city in Morocco 🪬 . When I was 3 years old, I moved to Tarragona 🏖️, another northern Mediterranean city in Spain, where I lived until it was time to start university.&#xA;I pursued a double bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Physics and Mathematics at the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB), focusing on Theoretical Physics (though I will always cherish my mathematician side 🤓). During the pandemic, I took a break from my academic path to explore data analysis while working at a green energy electric startup.</description>
