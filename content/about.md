# About Me

I am a passionate researcher in Quantum Science and Technology, currently serving as a Research Assistant at the Center of Quantum Technologies, National University of Singapore. My academic journey has been a thrilling exploration of the quantum realm, from foundational physics to cutting-edge quantum machine learning.

I hold a Master’s degree in Quantum Science and Technology, obtained in 2024, and a Double Bachelor’s degree in Physics and Mathematics, with a final grade of 8.1/10. My research focuses on quantum optimization and qubit-efficient encoding schemes, and I have a keen interest in the practical applications of quantum machine learning.

Before joining the National University of Singapore, I completed my Master Thesis at Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW), where I expanded the QUARK benchmarking framework and co-authored a paper on Quantum Generative Learning. This work was presented at the IEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering. 

I also gained valuable experience as a Junior Project Manager at the Quantum Business Network, leading technology transfer and innovation projects, and as a Junior Sales Data Analyst at Holaluz, optimizing data extraction and management processes.

In addition to my research, I enjoy contributing to science communication and education. I participated in the "Xplorers" documentary, highlighting my journey as a young scientist from Catalonia. I also volunteer as a Catalan teacher at Casal Català de Munich, fostering language and cultural learning among children.
