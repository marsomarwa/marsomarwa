Hi, I’m Marwa! 👋

I am a Research Assistant 🎓 in Quantum Computing at the National University of Singapore where I work in the group of Prof. Dimitris Angelakis🏛 

My current research focuses in on Qubit-Efficient Encoding Schemes, which essentially help us do more with fewer qubits when we're tackling Binary Unconstrained Optimization problems. At the same time, I'm also exploring how these algorithms can be used to train Quantum Generative Models to create and understand complex data patterns ⚛️
